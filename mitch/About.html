        <h1>Project VI - About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the <i>about</i> page for <b>The Tower of Terror</b><br/>
        This is where we will provide an overview of our project.
        In this project we will design an elevator system.

        The purpose of this project is to build and control and elevator, leveraging the use of 
        a CAN bus coummincations environment, coupled with networked systems to create a means
        of tracking the elevators operational/diagnostics data. The car position of the elevator 
        must also be viewable to computers over the Internet.
